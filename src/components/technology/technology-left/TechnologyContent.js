        A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to
        carry a payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or
        beyond. Our WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation.
        Standing 150 metres tall, it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the
        launch pad!
